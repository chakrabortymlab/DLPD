# Drosophila Laboratory Pangenome Database (DLPD)
Since T.H. Morgan and his associates in the famous Fly Room began their foundational work in genetics using the mighty fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_, numerous strains of _D. melanogaster_ with diverse genetic backgrounds have been used in laboratories worldwide. These include transgenic strains, deficiency strains, RNAi, genome editing, and balancers, as well as wild-type strains (e.g., Oregon-R, w1118, Canton-S). The genetic background of these strains differs from the reference strain ISO1 and is unknown. These uncharacterized differences confound the interpretation of experiments investigating the genotype-phenotype relationship using these non-reference laboratory strains. To solve this problem, we introduce the Drosophila Laboratory Pangenome Database (DLPD), a collection of ever-growing reference genome assemblies of popular _D. melanogaster_ laboratory strains. Although we will release eleven genome assemblies initially, more will be added in the future (depending on the feedback from the community). 

# Submit a Sequencing Request for your Strain of Interest
Do you work with a popular strain of _D. melanogaster_ that doesn't have a high-quality reference genome assembly? Please submit the following form to request that we sequence your strain of interest for inclusion in our database: [Google Forms DLPD Request](https://forms.gle/2m8gByd5vhed84xM9) (Strains requested by multiple labs will be prioritized)

# Data Access
We are in the final stage of setting up a genome browser for easy access to this data and will provide a link to the browser and the full dataset here. Stay tuned!
Meanwhile, please send any requests for the genome assembly or the raw reads to either tdmillar@tamu.edu or mahul@tamu.edu

*N50 and L50 are measures used to evaluate the quality of genome assemblies. The contig N50 is a value in megabase pairs which quantifies how well the assembly process has pieced together the genome. Specifically, 50% of the assembly is found in contigs (pieces) that are N50_value or longer. The L50 represents the number of contigs that represent the same 50% of the genome assembly. For comparison, the N50 and L50 values for the ISO1 reference assembly are 21.5 Mb and 3. 

**Hi-C contact data is being used to phase and improve de novo genome assemblies for the balancer chromosomes
